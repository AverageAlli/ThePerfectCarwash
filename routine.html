        <ul class="routine-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
                <span class="step-toggle">Rinse the car to remove loose dirt.</span>
                <div class="step-content">Start by using a hose to rinse the entire vehicle, focusing on the wheels and lower panels where dirt tends to accumulate. This step helps to remove any loose debris and prevents scratching during washing.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong>
                <span class="step-toggle">Apply car shampoo using a soft sponge or mitt.</span>
                <div class="step-content">Mix a high-quality car shampoo with water in a bucket. Using a microfiber sponge or mitt, start washing from the top down, rinsing the sponge frequently to avoid dirt buildup. This ensures that you donâ€™t transfer dirt back onto the car.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 3:</strong>
                <span class="step-toggle">Rinse the car thoroughly.</span>
                <div class="step-content">Once the entire car has been washed, rinse it thoroughly with clean water, starting from the top and working your way down. Make sure to remove all soap residues to avoid streaks and spots.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 4:</strong>
                <span class="step-toggle">Dry with microfiber towels.</span>
                <div class="step-content">Use clean, dry microfiber towels to gently dry the car. Pat the surface instead of rubbing to prevent scratches. Ensure that all areas, including door jambs and under the mirrors, are dried to prevent water spots.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 5:</strong>
                <span class="step-toggle">Apply detail spray after initial drying, and buff in with a microfiber towel.</span>
                <div class="step-content">Once the car is mostly dry, apply a detail spray or quick wax to enhance shine. Use a clean microfiber towel to buff the surface, applying even pressure and circular motions for the best finish.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 6:</strong>
                <span class="step-toggle">Apply wax or polish for a lasting shine.</span> 
                <div class="step-content">Choose a quality car wax or polish. Apply a thin layer using an applicator pad, working in small sections. Allow it to haze, then buff it off with a clean microfiber towel to reveal a deep shine.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 7:</strong>
                <span class="step-toggle">Clean the tires with a tire cleaner.</span>
                <div class="step-content">Use a dedicated tire cleaner and a stiff brush to scrub the tires. This removes dirt, grime, and brake dust, ensuring a clean finish. After cleaning, consider applying a tire shine product to enhance the appearance.</div>
